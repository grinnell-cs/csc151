;;; Parameters:
;;;   fname, a string
;;; Purpose:
;;;   Reads and returns all of the characters in the file
;;; Produces:
;;;   chars, a list of characters
;;; Preconditions:
;;;   fname names a valid file
;;; Postconditions:
;;;   chars contains all of the characters in the file.

;;; Preconditions:

;;;     of port at the beginning until (a) the first occurence of terminator,
